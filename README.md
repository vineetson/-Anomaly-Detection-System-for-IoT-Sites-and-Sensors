# Attack-and-Anomaly-Detection-in-IoT-Sensors-and-Sites-Using-Machine-Learning-Approaches

As we know there is rapid growth and demand for IoT devices nowadays. Also, people are becoming
more and more habitual of IoT technology & data-driven technology which leads us to rely on machine
learning alongside IoT. And there are numerous applications nowadays in this human ecosystem
presently.

As the IoT infrastructure is growing, it is becoming more and more complex and raising unwanted vulnerabilities to the system. Consequently,
security breaches and anomalies have become a common phenomenon nowadays in IoT devices.

After this study it was found that one should use RF technique on these kinds of dataset for solving cyberattacks on IoT network
because RF predicted attacks more accurately compared to other approaches. Hence, relying on these estimations, it can be
concluded that RF is the best technique for this particular study.
